\f0\fs24 \cf0 Real runtime is inversely proportional to the amount of slope in the given terrain. This is not reflected in O(N^2 + X) because the worst case remains the same no matter how much slope there is. Our code breaks out of the loop checking for slope at a given point once it knows the point is sloped, which only affects big-Omega and Theta.}
